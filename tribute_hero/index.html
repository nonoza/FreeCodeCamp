        <p class="p2">Myles Munroe was born in Nassau, Bahamas in 1954 and has been a lifetime resident of the Bahamas. He has degrees in fine arts, education and theology from Oral Roberts University (1978), a Master’s degree in administration from the University of Tulsa (1980), and he has been awarded a number of honorary doctoral degrees. He has also served as an adjunct professor of the Graduate School of Theology at Oral Roberts University. His wife, Ruth Munroe is co-pastor with him at BFMI. He has a son Chairo (Myles Jr.) and daughter Charisa.</p>
        <p class="p2">
         He died in a plane crash, along with his wife Ruth and daughter Charisa and members of his Bahama Faith Ministries.Severe weather was thought to be a factor in the crash. Heavy rain was buffeting the region when the Lear 36 Executive Jet exploded on impact with a crane at the Grand Bahama Ship Yard and plunged into a junkyard below as it was approaching Freeport. A commercial flight on the same route had turned back around the same time because it was unable to land.</p>
        <p class="p2">The Bahamian Prime Minister, Perry Christie, paid tribute: “It is utterly impossible to measure the magnitude of Dr Munroe’s loss to the Bahamas and to the world. He was indisputably one of the most globally recognisable religious figures our nation has ever produced. His fame as an ambassador for the Christian ministry preceded him wherever in the world he travelled.” <a style ="color:#012;" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/myles-munroe-influential-evangelical-preacher-who-outraged-many-with-his-views-on-women-and-gays-9854548.html" target="_blank"><strong>Read More</strong></a></p>
